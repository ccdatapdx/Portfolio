Welcome to my portfolio! I am showcasing each data project within multiple repositories. I have chosen to use AWS Lambda Docker images, and thus I have seperate repositories for each.

# TechMeme Headlines Pipeline

https://techmeme.com/

Inspiration:

At my previous job, the PR account executive folks, doing communication with press to drive news coverage, would use a site called TechMeme...

Once I learned about this practice after helping out on some reporting on the site for mentions of various tech brands, 
I started using it myself to follow tech news.

It is a news aggregator, but what differentiates it is human curation of news stories, written by tech journalists who are very influential...

The PR folks, obviously viewed it as meaningful to get news placements from the various outlets and particular journalists.

From their site: "Our experience leads us to believe that a thoughtful combination of both algorithmic and human editing offers 
		 the best means for curating in a space as broad as technology"

For me, with the incredible amount of news that is out there, I find it very convenient to be able to go to one source for overall
news and find out if something big has happened.

I would like to be able to not only see the quantity of companies, but to be able to search the headlines 
(which only go back so far on the site itself).
